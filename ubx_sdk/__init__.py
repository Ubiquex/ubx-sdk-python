"""ubx_sdk -- the describe-only Python runtime surface (UBI-36), mirroring
sdk/go/runtime and sdk/ts/runtime's semantics: stack/resource/secret/
cross/intent, Computed as a reference, never a value. A program using
this package never computes, never reaches a provider, never touches a
ledger -- it describes a desired end-state (an intent/v1 document) and
stops.

Unlike @ubx/sdk (runs inside a sandboxed interpreter alongside the
program) and unlike sdk/go/runtime (the compiled binary itself IS the
sandboxed unit), this package runs INSIDE a WASI sandbox (wasmtime + a
CPython-WASI build) alongside the program that imports it -- see
docs/sdk.md's "The Python evaluator: decided empirically" for the full
account of why that's hermetic. It deliberately never touches fs/net/
subprocess itself -- doing so would fail exactly the way a malicious
program's own attempt would (WASI does not distinguish "the runtime
library" from "the program," by design).

# keep drilling into a nested attribute and still produce a valid,

# attribute-customization hook -- __getattr__ -- an ordinary, idiomatic
# Python mechanism (used by countless dot-dict/ORM/mock libraries), not
# an imitation of JS's Proxy trap semantics. Coercion into a real value
# is blocked via Python's own actual implicit-coercion protocol methods
# (__str__/__bool__/__int__/__float__/__index__/__iter__/__len__) --
# the Pythonic equivalent of TS's COERCION_TRAPS, not a literal port of
# JS's own trap list (Python has no Symbol.toPrimitive; __repr__ is left
# alone deliberately, since unlike JS's toString it is never implicitly
# invoked by concatenation/arithmetic, only ever called explicitly for
# debugging -- blocking it would only hurt debuggability for no real
# safety gain).
